Automated my AI learning with a self-updating weekly digest.

**Architecture:**
- Python aggregates from arXiv API, Hacker News API, Reddit JSON feeds
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 curates and categorizes content into research papers, industry updates, tools & frameworks
- Beautiful futuristic HTML/CSS webpage with animated gradients
- GitHub Actions runs every Sunday at 6 PM (cloud-based, no local machine needed)
- Auto-deploys to GitHub Pages via gh-pages branch

**Focus:** Agentic AI - autonomous agents, multi-agent systems, LLM tooling, AI frameworks

No manual curation. No weekly reminders. Just automated learning delivered every Sunday.
